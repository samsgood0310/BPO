### What is BPO?
  **Bin Packing Optimization** (BPO) is a free and open-source application solving 3D bin packing problems. 
  The Application Framework based on Dash-Plotly and is very modular and can be easily customized and fit any specific problem, requirements and limitations.


### How does BPO Application work?
  By inputting the dimensions and quantities of the boxes you want to pack and the containers where the packages will be stored, 
  you can obtain a solution to the problem in a 3D graph. The app provides a KPI dashboard with an analysis of the solution.      
  BPO does not collect any data  and can be run offline.
