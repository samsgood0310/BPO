#### Application Structure
The BPO web-application is based on Dash-Plotly framework / packages, while the backed data-process and the solver Algorithm use mostly Pandas objects and customized modules and functions that were wrote for this app.    
with that say, each part of the app can run independently and this why other algorithms and applications with other use-cases can use this framework.
